JVM Shutdown Hook in Java
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jvm-shutdown-hook-java/
   Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() )
  1. Shutdown Hooks may not be executed in some cases!
  2. Once started, Shutdown Hooks can be forcibly stopped before completion.
  3. We can have more than one Shutdown Hooks, but their execution order is not guaranteed.
  4. We cannot register / unregister Shutdown Hooks with in Shutdown Hooks
  5. Once shutdown sequence starts, it can be stopped by Runtime.halt() only.
  6. Using shutdown hooks require security permissions.

JDBC Drivers
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/jdbc-drivers/
1.Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is an application programming interface (API) for the programming language Java, 
which defines how a client may access any kind of tabular data, especially relational database.
2.The JDBC classes are contained in the Java Package java.sql and javax.sql.
JDBC helps you to write Java applications that manage these three programming activities:
a.Connect to a data source, like a database.
b.Send queries and update statements to the database
c.Retrieve and process the results received from the database in answer to your query
3.There are 4 types of JDBC drivers:
a.Type-1 driver or JDBC-ODBC bridge driver
b.Type-2 driver or Native-API driver
c.Type-3 driver or Network Protocol driver
d.Type-4 driver or Thin driver
